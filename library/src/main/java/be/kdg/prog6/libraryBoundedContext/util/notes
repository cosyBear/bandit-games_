so when we go to the store front
we dont want the player to by the same game.



so the goal of  the library is used  to  show what  games that the player have

what about all the other game that the player dont have ?
one way to solve it is just by creating a library that holds all the games
so that when the player buy a game we just add it to his list of games  or mark the game as owned ?

so the game maybe should have like does own_game Attributes  . ........

or split the it own bounded context


=======================================================

so we have a like a Global library for all the games

so one library with  all the games in the store

and each player has his own library

when a player buys the game we  just add it to the player library.


======================================================================
game class

    // add a review list for this game
    //also add rating for the game
    // so you can show it in the most recommended  games list

    // add game description
    // add ame rules

    //cant give discrption without buying it
    //also when adding a game the review should be null

    // also think about how you going to create a game for the developer
    // maybe make a developer bounded context
    // where you add games and delete games
