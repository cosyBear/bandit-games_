so when we go to the store front
we dont want the player to by the same game.



so the goal of  the library is used  to  show what  games that the player have

what about all the other game that the player dont have ?
one way to solve it is just by creating a library that holds all the games
so that when the player buy a game we just add it to his list of games  or mark the game as owned ?

so the game maybe should have like does own_game Attributes  . ........

or split the it own bounded context




so one library with  all the games in the store

and each player has his own library

when a player buys the game we  just add it to the player library. just check if its good.
