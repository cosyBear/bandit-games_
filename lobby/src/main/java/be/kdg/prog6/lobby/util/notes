make a class  in tje  friends bounded

so when a player want to join a lobby
he make a httpq reuest we make a object  out of this class
than we would save it to the database the owener of the lobby can say yes or no

yes we update the state of the object to apcted or what not






////////////////
so what i would do create like Request Access
the player has a list of that

it conatins the lobby id the guestID, and  PlayerId , and Status.

so when he click join lobby i would create a object
 and save it to that player

that i would show the player his list of request
 acsses with status notVerfied or what not

if he say or no i make a htttp request

if he accpeted i would make a htrtp call to the

lobby bounded context to add the player ot lobby.
