2. Player Invites Friends
Trigger: The player sees a list of friends (retrieved from the Friends Context) and selects players to invite.
Action:
For each invited friend, the frontend sends an HTTP request to the Friends Context to create an invite.
Payload:
json
Copy code
{
  "lobbyId": "UUID",
  "gameId": "UUID",
  "senderId": "UUID",
  "receiverId": "UUID"
}

Logic in the Friends Context:
Validate the invite:
Check if the receiverId exists.
(Optional) Validate if the sender and receiver are friends.
Create an Invitation record with status = PENDING.
Notify the invited players (e.g., via WebSocket, push notification, or email).


3. Invited Player Accepts the Invite
Trigger: The invited player clicks "Accept Invite" in their UI.
Action:
The frontend sends an HTTP request to the Friends Context to accept the invite.
Payload:
json
Copy code
{
  "invitationId": "UUID",
  "receiverId": "UUID"
}
Logic in the Friends Context:
Validate the request:
Check that the invitationId exists.
Ensure the invite is for the receiverId and is still PENDING.
Update the Invitation status to ACCEPTED.
Publish a PlayerAcceptedInviteEvent to notify other contexts.
